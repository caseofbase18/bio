                <img src="./assets/Casey1.jpg">
                <p>
                    Born in Texas, Casey Natale Maltese spent her childhood in Texas, New Jersey, and South
                    Carolina. She
                    played soccer and participated in dance as a youngster, but at the age of 11 she discovered
                    what
                    would
                    utlimately change the course of her life: music. She began playing the clarinet in her
                    school's
                    sixth-grade band, and then switched to the French horn a few months later. This switch to
                    the
                    horn
                    opened a world of opportunities in which she eagerly took advantage, and ultimately led to
                    scholarships
                    to study music performance at the Florida State University and the University of Miami. Upon
                    completion
                    of her education, Casey became an educator and freelance French horn player in South Florida
                    where she
                    is currently located.

                    In her spare time, Casey can be found training for or running in 5k, 10k, and half-marathon
                    races. She
                    can also be found cooking, painting, occasionally SCUBA diving, listening to and playing
                    classical
                    music, and doing anything creative. She is now exploring the world of web development in
                    hopes
                    of
                    opening more creative and professional opportunities.
